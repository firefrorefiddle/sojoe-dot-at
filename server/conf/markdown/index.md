Welcome to sojoe.at
===================

This is my personal website. My name is Michael Hartl and I am a software developer.

Why would anyone have a personal website at all? First and foremost I intend it to 
be a tool to presenting myself to a potential employer in lieu of a CV. Rather than 
give a list of check-marks of things I can or cannot do, I would like to give you 
a more glimpse of the things I am excited about and show you why I think they are great.

You can guess from this that right now as of Jan 2016 I am looking for new employment,
and there is a [page](/page/job) dedicated to this. Nevertheless, I hope to keep the site online and
evermore interesting with blog posts even after I have found it.

I am convinced that this should give a better impression about me and about any 
potential cooperation.

What's there to look at?
------------------------
Take a look at the links on top. There is the boring personal facts stuff in [Curriculum Vitae](/page/cv),
a list of some of my projects and short articles in [Projects/Technical Stuff](/page/projects),
silly cheesy pictures in [What is SoJoE?](/page/about) and the impressum in [Contact](/page/contact).
