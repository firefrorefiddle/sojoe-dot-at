Future
------
Presenting a CV most-recent first, what is the most recent? If its not the future yet, then it will soon be. I am planning a move away from Vienna and back to my home town Saalfelden this summer (around August).

I do not known what I will be doing then, but I would like to develop great software for a company in the area (I am not particularly fond of teleworking and work best when I see my colleages face to face).

Now, on to the present and past.

	This was full-time work for the first few months up to the point where I decided to start my university studies; after that I stopped working for a year, and then started part-time for most of the rest.
	I worked on background processes mostly in C++ (some C#/.NET). That was network programming, specifically daemons (services) which constituted the backend of complete systems for situation rooms. A large part of my job was converting programs to Unicode versions.<br>

Early Life
----------

I grew up in [Saalfelden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saalfelden), a beautiful town in the midst of the Austrian Alps. I got my first computer at around age 10 (so this was in the early 90s), and I think it was an 8086 IBM XT (second hand, after it was retired from my father's office). In any case, it was a great system. It had a black-and-white monitor and was equipped with MS-DOS 3.30a and some business software I didn't understand.

Lacking a mouse or Windows I soon became more knowledgeable about the command line, although it was not before my second computer, an 80286 (no Windows either - I didn't miss it much though!) that I learned all the commands in the manual by heart (DOS 5.00; in those days it was really simple to do, I think it was only about 50 or so commands. Compare that to a contemporary Linux distribution!).

I did my first "programming" by looking at the files comprising an account program (I think) called MultPlan. I found out that they described simple menus you could navigate through with the keyboard so I started writing kind of an adventure game using it. Of course I didn't know about turing completeness or combinatorial explosions or I would not have tried such an impossible endeavour.

Later I learned a bit of QBasic and Turbo Pascal just by looking at source code and reading online help and remember it as quite overwhelming. So it was not before I learned JavaScript, Java and some other things at school and until the Internet revolutionized my life when I was 17 that I really "got into" programming.
