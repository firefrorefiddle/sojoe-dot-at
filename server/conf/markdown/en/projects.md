Projects and Technical Stuff
============================

* [ScalaJS](/page/scalaJS).

You can view some of my projects at GitHub. These are mostly toy things but you can get a feel of which technologies I like.

* [sojoe-dot-at](https://github.com/firefrorefiddle/sojoe-dot-at) is actually the source code for this site, which I write more about [here](/page/thisSite).
* [twodee](https://github.com/firefrorefiddle/twodee) is a toy library featuring 2d shapes together with linear algebra. I demonstrate this [here](/page/scalaJS) with JavaScript animations written in Scala. [ScalaJS](http://www.scala-js.org) makes this possible.
* [ants](https://github.com/firefrorefiddle/ants) is a very tiny little demo of Software Transactional Memory (STM) in Haskell. I basically just tried it out for an hour or two and was impressed. You can certainly find better demos of STM, but the technology itself is promising.
* [futureBack](https://github.com/rivalitaet/futureBack) is a backup program written in Haskell which I did together with a friend for a uni course.
* [songmaker](https://github.com/firefrorefiddle/songmaker) is a Haskell program which converts songs with chords written in a beginner-friendly custom format to LaTeX songbook.sty format. Together with [Liedermappe](https://github.com/firefrorefiddle/Liedermappe) I made it for the production of my church's song books.
